# Grandeur Cloud Dashboard
This project is about the development of Grandeur Cloud Dashboard which will be an end point of Grandeur Cloud API from where users could manage their projects and their Grandeur based IoT devices.

## How to Contribute
To contribute you will have first have to download the repository from cloud and this can be done by runnig this command in your command prompt

```
git clone -b development https://gitlab.com/grandeurtech/grandeur-cloud-dashboard
```

After cloning the code you can make edits and you can keep on introducing the edits into your local git repository by typing this command in your command prompt after opening it inside the repo directory

```
git add .
```

This will introduce the changes that you have made in your code to your local backup. Then once you reach a milestone or fix a bug/issue in your code you can run the following command to commit your changes


```
git commit -m "Your friendly message"
```

And then in order to submit the code to global cloud repository, just run the push command and this command will make your code globally synchronized where I will track the issues and will report to fix.


```
git push origin development
```

Since git is all about version control system and sometimes you can struct into a situation where things don't really seem to work out after your edits and you would be in need of your code back. Then following command can help you in brining back your last commit code


```
git reset --hard
```

Finally, it is possible that sometimes the other members can also contribute to the repo and may be you would in need of the updated code for example you struct in some issue and you asked your other team mates to help you and they uploaded the code to the web repo. Then you can get the latest copy of code from the web and keep synched by running the following command


```
git pull origin development
```

This sums up your introduction to git contribution and version management system.
